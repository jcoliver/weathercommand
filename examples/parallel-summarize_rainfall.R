# Remember https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-go-parallel-in-r-basics-tips/
# With small data set, parallel takes longer (0.8 vs. 2.4 seconds).
# With medium data set, parallel still takes longer (10.7 vs. 22.8 seconds); a 
# substantial part of this is setting up the cluster and breaking the data into 
# a list object (9.9 seconds), but even just the parallel execution of 
# summarize_rainfall takes 12.8 seconds. Consider a dplyr analog to split.
# With large data set, the parallel approach takes longer (203 vs. 62 seconds);
# even just the parLapply execution takes a substantial amount of time (153) 
# seconds.

# There is still a MASSIVE memory leak. After running this with the large data
# and clearing the environment with rm(list = ls()), the rsession was still 
# holding onto 3.4 GB of RAM. A call to gc() freed up a little bit (0.4 GB), but 
# still not enough.

# Try the .ls.objects function at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1358003/tricks-to-manage-the-available-memory-in-an-r-session
# to see if there is something hanging around. Especially after an rm() call. 

# See also https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/profmem/vignettes/profmem.html
# for using profmem

# Also in the thread of the above SO topic is this quote: 
#   "If you really want to avoid the leaks, you should avoid creating any big 
#   objects in the global environment. What I usually do is to have a function 
#   that does the job and returns NULL â€” all data is read and manipulated in 
#   this function or others that it calls."
