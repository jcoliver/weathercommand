# Results for rain calculations

All values that end with "_by_year" reflect values that are calculated for
multiple years, and the resulting output has one column for each year. These are
placeholders for actual column names. For example, there is no column in the
output called "mean_season_by_year", but there are "mean_season_1985", 
"mean_season_1986", "mean_season_1987", etc.
